        <h5>Ajax File: card-as.html</h5>
        <h6>Position: AS</h6>
        <p>Position &quot;as&quot; will replace the target container completely! Other existing loadMeThere links to this target won't work anymore.</p>
        <p>To prevent this: the file (content) that replaces the target container should brin a own copy of the target container. Just look at this files sourcecode which has replaced the original target container. On first line it brings a new target container back.</p>
